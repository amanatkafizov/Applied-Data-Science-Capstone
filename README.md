SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
The python notebooks in this repository are used to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
